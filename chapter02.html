<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>The next thing I know is the feeling of being firmly enveloped in something warm and soft.</p>

<p>I open my eyes. Just inches away is a face so perfect and flawless I almost feel hideous in comparison. <br>The face is so beautiful
it could have belonged to girl, yet somehow I can tell the face belongs to a male.</p>

<p>As I stare at the face I begin to take into account the fact that his arms are wrapped around me, supporting me.</p>

<p>I wrench my eyes off his face long enough to notice his pair of brilliantly white feathered wings moving up and down; flapping.</p>

<p>I turn my gaze back to his face. "Angel," I say in amazement and wonder, my voice unexpectedly clean and clear. "You're an angel."</p>

<p>"Oh my God, the smoke!" I gasp, my eyes widening as I suddenly remember what had just taken place.</p>

<p>Seeing the horror in my eyes the angel answers in a sorrowful tone in an almost otherworldly voice, "I'm sorry. There was a fire."</p>

<p>I stare at him in shock as time stands still when he says, "All your family passed on."</p>

<p>After an eternity I fearfully ask, "Me?"</p>

<p>His eyes are full of sorrow and regret as he says, "You died along with them."</p>

<p>Tears stream down my face as I stare off into the distance, not actually seeing anything.</p>
