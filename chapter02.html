<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>The next thing I know is the feeling of being firmly enveloped in something warm and soft.</p>

<p>I open my eyes. Just inches away is a face so perfect and flawless I almost feel hideous in comparison. <br>The face is so beautiful
it could have belonged to girl, yet somehow I can tell the face belongs to a male.</p>

<p>As I stare at the face I begin to take into account the fact that his arms are wrapped around me, supporting me.</p>

<p>I wrench my eyes off his face long enough to notice his pair of brilliantly white feathered wings moving up and down; flapping.</p>

<p>I turn my gaze back to his face. "Angel," I say in amazement and wonder, my voice unexpectedly clean and clear. "You're an angel."</p>

<p>"Oh my God, the smoke!" I gasp, my eyes widening as I suddenly remember what had just taken place.</p>

<p>Seeing the horror in my eyes the angel answers in a sorrowful tone in an almost otherworldly voice, "I'm sorry. There was a fire."</p>

<p>I stare at him in shock as time stands still when he says, "All your family passed on."</p>

<p>After an eternity I fearfully ask, "Me?"</p>

<p>His eyes are full of sorrow and regret as he says, "You died along with them."</p>

<p>Tears stream down my face as I stare off into the distance, not actually seeing anything.</p>

<p>I think of my family, of my mom, dad, and little sister. We were a fairly normal family. Mom was a nurse, dad a college professor,<br>
and Lana in preschool. Even though we had our fair share of arguments we loved each other. We all also had our own passions.<br>
Dad had his gardening, Mom had knitting, Lana well, she was Lana, a cute little girl overflowing with energy and happiness (most of the time, anyway).<br>
Me, I had painting. I had my pictures of starry nights, wildflowers, and everything nature.</p>

<p>My family was Catholic. We went to mass every Sunday but weren't extremely religious. We believed in God, Jesus,<br>
and everything but didn't pray at home or work at soup kitchens in our spare time.</p>

<p>We had a pet cat, Tammy. We'd had her since before Lana was born. Not too long, but then again Tammy wasn't a young cat.<br>
We adopted her from the humane society, taking pity on the middle-aged cat. We all loved Tammy. She loved to sit on our laps and purr<br>
and at night climb into bed with one of us. I wonder if Tammy made it; if she got out in time. Or she might have loyally died alongside us;<br>
her humans who gave her a second chance.</p>

<p>I think of school, of all my friends and teachers. I think of Jack who teased me, of Meredith who was there for me,<br>
of Carly whom you couldn't help love, of Jeremy who was clueless, and of Abby the 'smart one'. I think of Mr. Peters<br>
who was our hardest teacher and who wanted us to succeed. I think of Ms. Brookly who was always there to talk to us about our problems.<br>
No matter whether our parents were getting divorced, our boyfriend broke up with us or a new episode of our favorite TV show premiered<br>
the night before she was always there for us. I think of Ms. Stangle our principal who tried too hard to be our 'pal'.</p>

<p>My thoughts are interrupted as I get a feeling of stillness and of something stable under my feet. I refocus my eyes on the angel. "here are we?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Look around," he replies.</p>
