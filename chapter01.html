<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<p>It wasn’t the fire that killed us; it was the smoke.</p>

<p>I was dreaming that I was Anne Frank. You know, that one Jewish girl in the time of the Holocaust.<br>
I dreamt that my family and I had to live upstairs, hiding in secret rooms in our own house while a different family lived downstairs.</p>

<p>Then, soldiers came to our door. They threw aside the bookcase guarding the entrance<br>
to our rooms and dragged us outside in the freezing cold one by one.</p>

<p>Next, I remember getting off a train and going inside the concentration camp.<br>
There were a bunch of soldiers pushing and shoving us into a shower house, saying we needed to take showers.</p>

<p>As soon as the door slammed shut behind the last person gas began to come out of the shower heads.<br>
We all began choking and gasping. A few people clutching their throats fell to the floor.</p>

<p>I began to cough and gasp, trying to suck in clean air, air that wasn’t poisoned.</p>

<p>That was when I woke up. Even as I woke I continued to cough and suffocate. It was unbearably hot around me.<br>
My eyes stung as I tried to open them, seeing only billowing smoke around me. A thick cloud of black smoke surrounded me<br>
so thickly I couldn’t see my hand five inches away from my face. Tears streaming down my face I continued to gasp for clean air,<br>
but I only continued to choke on smoke.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long it took, it could have been for eternity for all I know, but black fog began to creep into my vision.<br>
Even though I was still lying down I began to feel extremely light-headed and at the same time my head began to ache as if being pressed on by heavy weights,<br>
feeling as if it were to burst open. The blackness took over my vision and it all ended. Everything stopped all at once and I knew nothing.</p>
