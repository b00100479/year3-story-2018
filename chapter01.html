<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<p>It wasn’t the fire that killed us; it was the smoke.</p>

<p>I was dreaming that I was Anne Frank. You know, that one Jewish girl in the time of the Holocaust.<br>
I dreamt that my family and I had to live upstairs, hiding in secret rooms in our own house while a different family lived downstairs.</p>

<p>Then, soldiers came to our door. They threw aside the bookcase guarding the entrance<br>
to our rooms and dragged us outside in the freezing cold one by one.</p>

<p>Next, I remember getting off a train and going inside the concentration camp.<br>
There were a bunch of soldiers pushing and shoving us into a shower house, saying we needed to take showers.</p>
