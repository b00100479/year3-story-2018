<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p>The first thing I notice is that we are standing on a grassy hill. Right after that I realize we are overlooking a large city.<br>
However, it isn't like any other city I've seen. It is surrounded by grasslands on one side (the side we are on), large forests on another side,<br>
an ocean (I do mean an ocean, not a lake) on another, desert on yet another, and opposite that tundra. That isn't even the most surprising part.</p>

<p>The city itself is made up of low buildings only, no sky-scrapers or high risers. In the middle of the city there is an enormous park,<br>
five times the size of our Forest Park. Inside the park are life-size replicas of monuments from all over the world. I could see the Eiffel Tower,<br>
the Statue of Liberty, the Arch, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. There were even the pyramids, the Great Wall of China, Mount Rushmore, and much more.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" I ask in amazement.</p>

<p>"Here," he replies.</p>

<p>"Where is here?"</p>

<p>"No, I mean 'Here' is the name."</p>

<p>"This place is named 'Here'?" I ask, perplexed.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is neither "there" nor "anywhere" so it has to be 'Here'."</p>

<p>"Isn't that confusing?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Only at first. You'll get used to it.</p>

<p>"What kind of place is Here? Is this heaven, hell, purgatory, none of the above?"</p>

<p>"This is simply a stop on your way. As soon as you have accepted your life as a whole you can proceed on your journey of moving on."</p>

<p>"How long will that take?"</p>

<p>"Each person is different. I've seen people stay here for as little as an hour and as long as several years."</p>

<p>"Years?!" I exclaim.</p>

<p>"Those people are usually those who die suddenly or who have a lot to think through about their lives."</p>

<p>It looks like I could be here for a while.</p>

<p>We make our way slowly down the hill and towards the city. It is almost dark by the time we finally reach it.<br>
The angel leads the way through winding streets into the heart. The people we pass appear no different than their living counterparts,<br>
occasionally giving us a greeting. They are of every culture, race, and age. The only exception are the very young,<br>
those of kindergarten age and younger who are nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Where are the young children?" I ask softly.</p>

<p>"Young children who haven't developed a conscience automatically accept who they are.<br>
After they die they are simply taken to heaven," he replies just as softly.</p>

<p>Lana must be in heaven along with the other kids who died so young; happy. As I think of my sister,<br>
cheated out her childhood and a long life a single tear rolls down my face. An angel passing by notices the tear<br>
and gives a sympathetic smile, her expression full of compassion.</p>

<p>I give a small sad smile in return. It is at the same time I notice that not all the inhabitants are human; almost an equal amount are angels.<br>
Like the humans, the angels are of every race and culture. However, unlike the humans the angels are only teenagers and adults. No child angels.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the people I see are walking. There are no cars at all but I do see a few bicycles. Most of the angels also walk,<br>
but above us I do see a few flying, their white wings spread open wide, as long in length as the angels are tall.</p>
