<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p>Clothes greatly vary from person to person. Most people wear regular clothes while others not so regular.<br>
I see everything from jeans to furry Eskimo snowsuits to ball gowns to the kind of mismatched clothing a homeless person or<br>
what someone from a third world country would wear. The angels are similar in their dress code but some wear a long simple white robe,<br>
the same kind that my angel is wearing.</p>

<p>I glance down at myself and notice that I’m wearing an old pair of jeans and a red T shirt. Somehow I had magically changed from my pajamas<br>
to something I would normally wear. I frown, wondering how… Magic. That must be the answer. Or God. With him anything’s possible.</p>

<p>As the day light quickly fades my angel leads the way to a comely brick building. A sign in the front reads "Sixteen". My age.</p>

<p>As we come to a stop at the door the angel gives a few short knocks. I look over at him, a questioning look in my eyes.</p>

<p>He notices and says, "This is where you’ll be staying."</p>

<p>It is then the door opens with a motherly looking angel behind it. She has a kind expression on her face and has long curly golden blonde<br>
hair that goes down to her waist. Despite her wise maternal expression she looks very young, in her early twenties. However, that doesn't say<br>
much seeing as all the angels I've seen seem very young and perfect despite their apparent age.</p>

<p>The angel gives a soft smile and says in a voice full of sugar, honey, and sweetness and at the same time kindness, "Welcome Kaitlyn."</p>

<p>I stare at her and ask, "How do you know my name?"</p>

<p>She simply replies, "The Word of God."</p>

<p>The answer is left at that when she turns to my angel. "Be here at eight tomorrow."</p>

<p>"You're coming back?" I ask him.</p>

<p>"Yes. It's my duty to accompany you during your stay. We are to meet every day at least once. As for now I shall leave you in Cristina's<br>
capable care along with the others of your age."<br>
Cristina opens the door wider and I take a step inside but then glance back. "I guess I'll see you tomorrow..." I trail off awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Gabriel," he says, providing his name.</p>

<p>"As in the Gabriel?" I ask, eyes widening.</p>

<p>He gives a small wry smile and says, "No. I haven't been an angel that long."</p>

<p>"How long have you been an angel?" I ask, curiosity getting the better of me.</p>

<p>"That question will be better answered tomorrow," he replies gently. "Goodnight," and with that he turns and leaves.</p>
