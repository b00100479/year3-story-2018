<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p>The first thing I notice is that we are standing on a grassy hill. Right after that I realize we are overlooking a large city.<br>
However, it isn't like any other city I've seen. It is surrounded by grasslands on one side (the side we are on), large forests on another side,<br>
an ocean (I do mean an ocean, not a lake) on another, desert on yet another, and opposite that tundra. That isn't even the most surprising part.</p>

<p>The city itself is made up of low buildings only, no sky-scrapers or high risers. In the middle of the city there is an enormous park,<br>
five times the size of our Forest Park. Inside the park are life-size replicas of monuments from all over the world. I could see the Eiffel Tower,<br>
the Statue of Liberty, the Arch, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. There were even the pyramids, the Great Wall of China, Mount Rushmore, and much more.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" I ask in amazement.</p>

<p>"Here," he replies.</p>

<p>"Where is here?"</p>

<p>"No, I mean 'Here' is the name."</p>

<p>"This place is named 'Here'?" I ask, perplexed.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is neither "there" nor "anywhere" so it has to be 'Here'."</p>

<p>"Isn't that confusing?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Only at first. You'll get used to it.</p>

<p>"What kind of place is Here? Is this heaven, hell, purgatory, none of the above?"</p>

<p>"This is simply a stop on your way. As soon as you have accepted your life as a whole you can proceed on your journey of moving on."</p>

<p>"How long will that take?"</p>

<p>"Each person is different. I've seen people stay here for as little as an hour and as long as several years."</p>

<p>"Years?!" I exclaim.</p>
